# Newton { Algorithms }
This repository contains 1.) Differentiation and integration algorithms written in Python 2.) Simple GUI that can produce graphs base on given equation using [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib)

## List of algorithms

1. Interval bisection method (root finding)
2. Newtonâ€“Raphson method (root finding)
3. Trapezium rule (area finding)
4. Simpson's rule (area finding)

## Contributing

1. Fork this project!
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'New features'`
4. Push to branch: `git push origin new-features`
5. Submit a pull request

## Notes

1. Testing are done by Pytest and doctest. Just run `py.test` at the top directory to execute all test, you might need to run `export PYTHONPATH=.` for pytest to find all submodules.
